/**
 * Prove the leg `check-voice-loop.ts` cannot: that a browser plays the answer.
 *
 * The input leg has its own proof. This one exists because "the daemon emitted
 * a speech frame" and "a person heard the reply" are different claims, and
 * only the second one is what bi-directional voice means. Everything a browser
 * needs in order to be caught lying is here: the frame has to arrive at a real
 * page, decode to real samples, reach a real `AudioContext`, and finish
 * playing in real time.
 *
 * This script stands the daemon up and puts everything the browser needs where
 * the browser can reach it. Driving Chrome is the caller's job, because a
 * headless browser that cannot make sound is not evidence of anything.
 *
 *   bun run scripts/check-voice-playback.ts
 *
 * It prints one JSON line, then serves until killed.
