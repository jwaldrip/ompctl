/**
 * Live check that a routine fires on the real system clock and completes a real
 * agent turn.
 *
 * `packages/daemon/test/routines.test.ts` drives the scheduler with an injected
 * clock and a scripted peer, so it proves the decision logic and nothing about
 * the timer. This runs a real daemon on its own home and port, seeds routines
 * that come due within the next couple of minutes, and waits on the wall clock.
 * Everything it asserts is something a fake cannot show:
 *
 * - a `setInterval` tick actually notices a cron expression coming due
 * - a run transitions queued -> running -> terminal against real time
 * - a real `omp acp` agent leaves a file on disk, which outlives the process
 * - `singleton` skips a fire while the previous run is genuinely still going
 * - a routine that fails does not stop the timer; the next one still fires
 * - the host process, its gate-config overlay, and the run record are settled
 *
 * The load-bearing part is the approval accounting. A run that succeeded is not
 * evidence that policy allowed anything. Measured against the shipped omp
 * 17.2.12 binary, its ACP permission wrapper consults a table
 * `{bash, edit, delete, move}` keyed by tool *name*, and then a descriptor
 * helper that returns nothing unless the call is a `bash` command, a `delete`,
 * a `move`, or an `edit` that resolves to one of those. So `write`,
 * `multi_edit`, and any content-only `edit` execute with no
 * `session/request_permission` at all, and ompd's policy engine never sees
 * them.
 *
 * That is why every tool call the turn made is inventoried from the `updates`
 * table and joined against the `approvals` table by tool call id. A filesystem
 * side effect with no matching approval row is a gate that never fired, not a
 * policy that said yes, and this check fails on it. `docs/acp-approval-gate.md`
 * names that trap in the abstract; this is what detects it.
 *
 * Costs real model tokens. Phase `singleton` deliberately spends most of its
 * wall clock sitting at an unanswered approval gate.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-routine-live.ts                    # both phases
 *   bun run scripts/check-routine-live.ts --phase write
 *   bun run scripts/check-routine-live.ts --phase singleton
 *   bun run scripts/check-routine-live.ts --port 7793 --keep
