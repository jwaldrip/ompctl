/**
 * Prove the container host backend, end to end, against a real container.
 *
 * The unit tests for `ContainerBackend` mock the runtime, so they can only show
 * that the right argv was assembled. This drives the whole path: a daemon on
 * its own port and home, `POST /v1/agents` with a `kind: "container"` spec, an
 * `omp acp` inside the container, and the approval gate answered over the
 * client websocket.
 *
 * The gate is the part worth the trouble. `spawnLocalHost` writes the overlay
 * described in `docs/acp-approval-gate.md` to a path on the daemon's machine,
 * which does not exist inside the container; `gate-wrapper.ts` copies it across
 * and byte-verifies it. Nothing about that had ever been watched against a real
 * container, and the image below deliberately carries the operator's global
 * `tools.approvalMode: yolo`, the setting that makes omp skip the ACP
 * permission hook entirely. If the overlay does not arrive, the container runs
 * ungated and the deny round passes while enforcing nothing, which is why the
 * allow round and the overlay comparison both exist.
 *
 * Everything it creates is removed, including on the failure path: the
 * container, the workspace, the daemon home, and the image unless
 * `--keep-image` is given.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-container-host.ts [--keep-image] [--image <tag>]
