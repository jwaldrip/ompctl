/**
 * Pairing has to outlive the process, and revocation has to outlive it too.
 *
 * These tests are written against `DeviceAuth` and a real file-backed store,
 * because the property under test is precisely the one an in-memory double
 * cannot have: a credential issued by one instance must be honoured by the
 * next one, and a credential withdrawn by either must be refused by both.
 *
 * The other half is that "long lived" never becomes "unrevocable". Every way
 * a token can end is asserted here: the device is revoked, the token row is
 * revoked, or it is rotated out from under itself.
