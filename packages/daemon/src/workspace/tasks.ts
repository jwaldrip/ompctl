/**
 * Gives a task a first-class identity.
 *
 * A task is a named prompt against a session that already exists, tracked
 * through its own lifecycle row so a sidebar can render it as a card. It is
 * deliberately thin: every privileged act it performs -- sending the prompt,
 * cancelling it -- goes through `Supervisor`, which re-authorizes from the
 * actor's device row and is where the policy engine is reached. This module
 * adds naming and a pollable lifecycle; it adds no second path to an agent,
 * and in particular no shortcut that runs a skill outside the ordinary
 * prompt path. See `Task` in `@ompd/core` for why this is a table of its own
 * rather than fields bolted onto `Agent`.
