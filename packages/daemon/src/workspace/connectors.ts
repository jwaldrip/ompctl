/**
 * The connectors catalogue.
 *
 * `discoverMCPServers` is upstream's own resolution and connection of every
 * configured MCP server -- this module does not reimplement discovery, it
 * only reshapes the result into `ConnectorSummary` and tears the connections
 * back down. A listing call is a point-in-time health check, not a
 * subscription: the daemon holds no MCP connection open between calls, so
 * every listing pays the cost of a real connect attempt and reports what
 * actually happened, not a cached guess.
 *
 * Never a place a connector's config reaches: `.mcp.json` entries routinely
 * carry bearer tokens, OAuth client secrets, and API keys in `env` or
 * `headers`, and `ConnectorSummary` has no field for any of it. `redactString`
 * additionally scrubs the one field that touches arbitrary text -- `error` --
 * because a server's own rejection message can echo back what it was sent.
