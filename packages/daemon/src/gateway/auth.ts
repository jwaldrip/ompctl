/**
 * Device pairing and bearer-token auth.
 *
 * Pairing is two-step on purpose. A client that could name its own scopes would
 * turn pairing into a self-service privilege grant, which is the whole attack:
 * anything that can reach `POST /v1/pair` could then reach everything else. So
 * the HTTP half records an intent and grants nothing. Only `approvePairing`,
 * invoked by the operator out of band, writes a device row and mints a token,
 * and the scopes it writes are the operator's, never the client's.
 *
 * Tokens are 32 random bytes and only their SHA-256 hash is ever kept, so
 * neither the store nor a heap dump yields anything presentable.
 *
 * That hash lives in `auth_tokens`, not in this process. A pairing is a durable
 * fact about a device, and a daemon restart is not an operator decision to
 * withdraw it. Holding the hashes in memory logged every paired phone out on
 * every restart, silently and with nothing in the audit log, while the phone
 * went on presenting a credential it had every reason to believe in. A
 * credential now ends exactly one way: someone revokes or rotates it.
