/**
 * Keep the Mac awake while an agent is actually working.
 *
 * The point of running this daemon at all is that you start something from
 * your phone and it is still running when you look again. A Mac that goes to
 * idle sleep mid-turn kills the host process and the turn with it, so the
 * daemon has to say "not now" for exactly as long as there is work in flight.
 *
 * Scoped, not blanket. An always-on assertion is rude to a battery and would
 * be a lie about what the daemon needs: an idle daemon needs nothing. So the
 * assertion follows agent state and is released the moment the last one
 * settles.
 *
 * Idle sleep only, never display sleep. Preventing the screen from sleeping
 * would be a visible, annoying side effect of work happening in the
 * background, and it buys nothing.
 *
 * This cannot wake a Mac that is already asleep. Nothing running on the
 * machine can. It keeps a waking Mac awake, and that is the whole claim.
