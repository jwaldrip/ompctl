/**
 * The voice bridge: audio in, transcript out, speech back.
 *
 * This is the whole point of the voice slice. OMP's speech stack is excellent
 * and entirely local, and entirely unreachable from anywhere but the terminal
 * it is running in. The bridge is what carries it over the socket, so a phone
 * can hold a conversation with an agent that lives in the daemon.
 *
 * Three properties it must hold, in order of how badly they hurt when wrong:
 *
 * 1. A command never vanishes. If transcription fails, the client is told. An
 *    empty transcript is treated as a failure, not as silence, because the
 *    operator cannot distinguish the two and will assume the agent heard them.
 * 2. Buffered audio is capped. A client that opens a microphone and walks away
 *    is the normal case, not the adversarial one, and an uncapped buffer turns
 *    it into daemon memory growth measured in megabytes a minute.
 * 3. Frame handling never throws. The gateway calls `handleFrame` straight
 *    from a socket message, so a malformed frame must produce an error frame,
 *    not an unhandled rejection.
