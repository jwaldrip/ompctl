/**
 * Speech to text.
 *
 * OMP already runs state of the art ASR on this machine, on device: Parakeet
 * TDT v3 through sherpa-onnx, warm across recordings. None of it is
 * reimplemented here. What was missing was a way to reach it from outside the
 * TUI, and now that the control plane lives inside the fork, the way to reach
 * it is to call `SttClient` directly rather than to hunt for a subcommand on a
 * binary.
 *
 * The engines are ordered omp, null. The last one is not a no-op: a voice
 * command that silently evaluates to the empty string is worse than one that
 * errors, because the operator has no way to tell "the daemon heard nothing"
 * from "the daemon has no ears". Every engine here either returns real text or
 * throws, and when it throws it names the engine and the reason.
