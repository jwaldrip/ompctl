/**
 * Energy-based voice activity detection.
 *
 * Deliberately not a model. The bridge only needs one decision -- "has the
 * speaker stopped?" -- and an RMS threshold with hysteresis answers it well
 * enough that adding a neural endpointer would buy latency and a download for
 * no behavioural gain. omp's own live STT reached the same conclusion: its
 * endpointer is energy based, no extra model.
 *
 * Two thresholds, not one. A single threshold chatters: any frame sitting near
 * it flips speech/silence on consecutive frames and shreds the trailing-silence
 * count that ends an utterance. So entering speech takes a crossing of the
 * high threshold and leaving it takes a fall below the low one, which is a
 * Schmitt trigger and is what "hysteresis" means here.
 *
 * Everything in this file is pure. The bridge holds the audio; this holds the
 * arithmetic, so the interesting behaviour is unit-testable against synthetic
 * PCM with no device and no I/O.
