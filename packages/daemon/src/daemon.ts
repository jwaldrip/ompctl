/**
 * The composition root.
 *
 * Six slices were built against fixed contracts and none of them knows the
 * others exist. This is the one file that does: it opens the store, builds the
 * policy, and hands each subsystem exactly the collaborators it declared. Every
 * wiring decision that could otherwise be made twice, differently, is made here
 * once.
 *
 * Two of those decisions are load bearing.
 *
 * **Shutdown is ordered, and the order is not cosmetic.** The scheduler stops
 * first so no new run is queued, then the runs already in flight are drained
 * while the hosts serving them are still up: cancelling a turn needs its host,
 * and a run that cannot write its terminal record outlives the daemon as a row
 * stuck in `running`. The gateway closes next so no new request arrives, and
 * only then does the supervisor tear down running agents. Closing the gateway
 * after the supervisor would accept a request against a supervisor that had
 * already killed its hosts, which is how an in-flight agent is lost with a
 * client watching.
 *
 * **The local operator device is minted from the filesystem, not from
 * pairing.** Every API call needs a paired device, and the machine's own
 * operator has no way to pair with a daemon they cannot yet call. Writing a
 * token to a 0600 file under `~/.ompd` requires local filesystem access, which
 * already implies the ability to run arbitrary code as this user, so it grants
 * nothing that was not already held. It is a convenience for someone who is
 * already the operator, never a way in for someone who is not.
