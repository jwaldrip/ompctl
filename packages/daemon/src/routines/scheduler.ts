/**
 * Scheduled and triggered agent runs.
 *
 * A routine is a prompt plus a trigger. Firing one means standing up a fresh
 * agent, prompting it, and tearing it down again, recording the whole thing as
 * `Run`. Four properties are load bearing:
 *
 * - **A run never leaks an agent.** Teardown is in a `finally`, and if the
 *   supervisor cannot stop the agent the record is forced terminal anyway.
 *   Otherwise a routine that fails nightly quietly accumulates live hosts.
 * - **A run never leaks a record.** `drain` settles whatever is still in flight
 *   on the way out, because a row left at `running` outlives the process and
 *   keeps `hasActiveRun` true, which silences a singleton routine for good.
 * - **One bad routine is one bad routine.** A malformed trigger or a failing
 *   run must not stop the timer or the other routines due on the same tick.
 * - **Time is injected.** Scheduling decisions read `now()`, so the logic is
 *   testable without waiting on a clock.
