/**
 * The container backend.
 *
 * A detached container is started from a published image with the workspace
 * mounted at the same absolute path it has on the host, so a cwd the daemon
 * hands to `session/new` means the same thing on both sides. An operator may
 * name further host directories in `spec.mounts`; each lands at that same
 * identical absolute path inside, for the same reason. The ACP transport is
 * `<runtime> exec -i <id> omp acp`: a duplex byte stream, exactly like the
 * local pipe, which is why the supervisor needs to know nothing about this.
 *
 * The approval gate is preserved, not reimplemented. `spawn` delegates to
 * `spawnLocalHost` with `ompPath` pointing at a generated wrapper, so
 * `spawnLocalHost` still writes the overlay and still passes its own
 * `--config`; the wrapper copies that file into the container, verifies it,
 * and rewrites the flag. See `gate-wrapper.ts`. ompd never passes `--config`
 * and never authors the overlay.
 *
 * The run command is built per runtime, not assumed docker-shaped. Apple's
 * `container` CLI (0.4.1) has no flag for `--cap-drop`, `--security-opt`,
 * `--read-only`, or `--pids-limit`, and exits on an unknown flag rather than
 * ignoring it, so a docker-shaped command never provisions on it at all. See
 * `RUNTIME_FLAG_SUPPORT` below and `docs/running.md`'s per-runtime table for
 * what that means for confinement, which is not the same on every runtime and
 * is never silently rounded up to "the same as docker".

 * `docker` itself and `orbctl` talks to the same daemon), so `run` shapes the
 * same command for all three today. Apple's `container` 0.4.1 is a different
 * CLI -- it accepts `--user`, `--tmpfs`, `--volume`, `--network`, `--workdir`,
 * `--detach`, and `--rm`, but exits on `--cap-drop`, `--security-opt`,
 * `--read-only`, or `--pids-limit` as an unknown flag, so a docker-shaped

 * fails on the first unknown flag" and "provision silently claims a
 * confinement guarantee it never asked the runtime for": every new runtime
 * added to `CONTAINER_RUNTIMES` needs an entry here before it can be trusted.
 *
 * The four flags this table gates are not one thing. `--cap-drop`,
 * `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, and `--pids-limit` mitigate a
 * shared-kernel escape: a capability, a regained privilege, or a fork bomb
 * reaching past the container into the host's own kernel. Apple's `container`
 * gives each container its own lightweight VM, so there is no shared kernel
 * for any of those three to escape into in the first place -- their absence
 * there is a different boundary, not a hole in this one. `--read-only` is not
 * that: it is whether the image itself can be rewritten from inside, and
 * losing it is a real loss regardless of which kernel the container has.
 * `docs/running.md` reports it as one rather than folding it into the same
 * "different trade" story as the other three.
