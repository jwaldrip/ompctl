// The provisioner and the voice bridge each define a subprocess seam, and they
// picked the same two names for genuinely different shapes: the provisioner's
// `CommandRunner` is a function, the voice bridge's is an object with `which`
// and `run`. Two star exports of one name is ambiguous, so the plain names are
// bound explicitly to the provisioner's and the voice variants are re-exported
// under a prefix. Unifying them would couple two slices that have no reason to
// know about each other.
