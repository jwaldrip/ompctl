/**
 * Reverses the flattened session directory names OMP writes under
 * `~/.omp/agent/sessions/<flattened-cwd>/`, so the daemon can group sessions
 * by their real working directory.
 *
 * Mirrors the three encoding schemes in
 * `packages/coding-agent/src/session/session-paths.ts`
 * (`encodeRelativeSessionDirName`, `encodeLegacyAbsoluteSessionDirName`,
 * `getDefaultSessionDirName`), which are private to that module and not
 * exported. Reimplemented here, deliberately, rather than imported: those
 * functions can move or be renamed without notice, and this package would
 * rather fail a test against real directory names than depend on an internal
 * path it does not own. `encodeSessionDirName` below is kept in exact sync by
 * testing it against every awkward flattened name actually observed on a real
 * `~/.omp/agent/sessions/` tree (see cwd-codec.test.ts).
 *
 * The encoding is inherently lossy. `encodeRelativeSessionDirName` replaces
 * every `/`, `\`, and `:` in a relative path with the same `-`, so:
 *
 *   - A two-level directory ("a/b") and a hyphenated single directory ("a-b")
 *     flatten identically.
 *   - A home-relative "tmp/x" and a temp-relative "x" (i.e. `os.tmpdir()/x`)
 *     both flatten to "-tmp-x" -- home scope prefixes with "-" and that
 *     already ends in "-", so "-" + "tmp-x" == "-tmp" + "-" + "x".
 *
 * Decoding therefore never guesses a split. It walks the REAL directory tree
 * from each candidate scope root and only accepts a real subdirectory name as
 * a match for a prefix of the remaining flattened string, exactly as the
 * encoder would have produced it. A flattened name decodes with confidence
 * only when exactly one real directory reconstructs it byte-for-byte (proven
 * by re-encoding the candidate and comparing) across every scope that could
 * have produced it. Zero or more than one real match is reported as unknown.
 * A wrong guess would silently merge two projects' sessions into one group;
 * refusing to decode does not.
