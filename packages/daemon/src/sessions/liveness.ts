 * process liveness, so a record left behind by a process that crashed
 * without cleaning up its own file can never make a session look live.
 *
 * The registry is upstream's own mechanism (`registerDaemonProjectPresence`
 * in `packages/coding-agent/src/launch/presence.ts`), used here read-only.
 * `getDaemonRuntimeDir` is called with an arbitrary project directory purely
 * to recover its parent -- the `run/daemons` root that holds every project's
 * hash directory -- through the same XDG/profile-aware resolution upstream
 * itself uses, rather than reimplementing that resolution and risking it
 * drifting out of sync.
