 * Three layers travel this path and keeping them straight is what makes the

 *
 *   1. The hub envelope (this file). Routing only. The hub reads it.
 *   2. The sealed payload (`channel.ts`). AES-256-GCM between client and
 *      daemon. The hub carries it and cannot open it.
 *   3. The `ClientFrame`/`ServerFrame` pair the gateway already speaks, which
 *      travels inside layer 2 unchanged.
 *
 * Layer 3 being untouched is deliberate. `attach { sinceSeq }` replay works
 * through the tunnel precisely because the tunnel does not know what an attach
 * is, so there is no second place for replay to be got wrong.
