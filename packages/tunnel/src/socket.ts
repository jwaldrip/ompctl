/**
 * A tunnel session, wearing a websocket's face.
 *
 * `OmpdClient` already knows how to reconnect, track a per-agent high-water
 * mark, and re-`attach` with `sinceSeq`. None of that should be written a
 * second time for the tunnel, and a second copy would be the one that drifts.
 * So the tunnel presents the same small surface a `WebSocket` does, and the
 * client drives it without knowing a hub exists.
 *
 * That is what preserves lossless resume end to end. The tunnel never inspects
 * a session frame, never renumbers a `seq`, and never buffers across a
 * reconnect. When a session dies the socket closes; the client reconnects,
 * sends `attach` with the last seq it saw, and the daemon replays from its
 * durable update log. The tunnel's only obligation is to close loudly rather
 * than sit there looking healthy while frames go nowhere.
 *
 * ## The token never reaches the hub
 *
 * `OmpdClient` appends `?token=` to the URL it opens, because against a local
 * daemon that is the only way a browser can authenticate a websocket. Through a
 * hub that would hand the bearer straight to the relay. So this module takes
 * the token as its own argument, opens a credential-free URL, and presents the
 * token only inside the sealed channel, where the daemon is the only party that
 * can open it. `hubSocketUrl` exists to strip a token out of a URL that already
 * has one, for callers holding the shape `OmpdClient` builds.
