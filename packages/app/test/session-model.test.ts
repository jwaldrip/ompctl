/**
 * The reducer, ported byte-identically from the PWA, retested here.
 *
 * The point of running these again rather than trusting the web package's copy
 * is the port itself: this is the file the app actually imports, and a reducer
 * that drifted during the move would fail here and nowhere else. The fixture is
 * a verbatim recording of one real turn, so the assertions are about what an
 * ACP stream does rather than about what this implementation happens to do.
