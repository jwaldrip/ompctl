/**
 * Routing a dispatched WebView action, which has exactly one hard rule: every
 * path answers once.
 *
 * The daemon holds the agent's tool call open on a pending row until a
 * `webview_result` arrives. So the interesting cases are not the happy one:
 * they are the pane that closed before the frame landed, and the driver that
 * threw instead of resolving. Both of those are how a model ends up waiting on
 * a device that is never going to speak.
