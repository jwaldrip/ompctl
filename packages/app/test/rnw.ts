/**
 * Lets a bun test render the app's real React Native components.
 *
 * Two substitutions, and both are the same substitution the shipped web build
 * makes through Vite:
 *
 *  - `react-native` becomes `react-native-web`. This is what the web target
 *    does; there is no second implementation of the screens.
 *  - `react-native-svg` becomes a thin wrapper over the DOM's own `<svg>`
 *    elements, which is what that package's web build also does. It is stubbed
 *    rather than loaded because bun resolves `./elements` to the native file:
 *    picking `elements.web.js` over `elements.js` is a bundler behaviour, and
 *    bun's runtime resolver does not implement platform extensions. The stub
 *    passes path data straight through, so a rendered icon still carries its
 *    real Font Awesome geometry.
 *
 * Import this module first in any test that renders. ES modules evaluate their
 * dependencies in source order, so the mocks are registered before the
 * components that need them are loaded.
