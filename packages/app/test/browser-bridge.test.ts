/**
 * `browser/bridge.ts`: page content can only ever become data.
 *
 * `parseBridgeMessage`'s return type has exactly two variants -- `resolved`
 * and `dropped` -- and neither carries anything that could be read as "the
 * page wants an action performed." These tests prove the parser actually
 * enforces that at the three points a hostile or merely talkative page could
 * try: an unsolicited message with no request outstanding, a message that
 * does not match the one outstanding request's nonce, and a message shaped
 * to look exactly like a spoofed `navigate` action smuggled through the
 * `result` field a real bridge reply also uses.
