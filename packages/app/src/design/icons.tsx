/**
 * The icon vocabulary, drawn as real vectors.
 *
 * Every glyph is a Font Awesome path rendered through `react-native-svg`, which
 * is the only way to get one shape on five platforms: a webfont does not exist
 * on a phone, and an emoji is a picture of a concept rather than an icon of
 * one. Nothing in this app ever renders a character where an icon belongs.
 *
 * The console this ports from uses the Pro families: duotone for tool kinds, so
 * the kind's signal colour rides in the primary layer, and sharp for the two
 * decisions. Duotone, sharp, and thin are Pro-only, and this build has no Pro
 * registry token, so every entry below is the free solid family. The mapping is
 * one-for-one in meaning and the pairing is named in each comment where the Pro
 * glyph has no free twin.
 *
 * Icons are decorative here without exception. Anything an operator has to be
 * able to name carries a text label beside it, so the glyph is hidden from
 * assistive technology rather than given a label of its own.
