 * and nothing here is decorative. And the ground is warm graphite rather than
 * the blue-black every component kit ships, because an operator stares at this
 * for hours and a cold ground under amber signals reads as a dashboard warning
 * light rather than a working surface.
 *
 * No gradients, no translucency, no rounded corners. A strip either is or is
 * not, and a soft edge on a failure state is a lie about how the run went.
