 * The app lives inside the ompd workspace and imports `@ompd/core` from a sibling

 *
 * This file is CommonJS (`.cjs`) because the React Native CLI loads config
 * through a CJS path, and the app package declares `"type": "module"`.
 *
 * `disableHierarchicalLookup` is load-bearing for native. Without it, Metro
 * walks up from a file under the workspace-root `node_modules/react-native` and
 * finds the workspace's React 19.2.7 before the app-local 19.1.4 that matches
 * RN 0.81.6's embedded renderer. Two React copies produce the redbox the
 * device hit: "Incompatible React versions: ... 19.2.7 ... renderer 19.1.4".
 * With hierarchical lookup off, only `nodeModulesPaths` is consulted, so the
 * app pin wins for every import including the ones inside react-native itself.
