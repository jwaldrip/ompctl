/**
 * Pairing and device management.
 *
 * Two steps, and the split is the security property: `pair` records an intent
 * and grants nothing, `approve` is the operator act that writes a device row
 * and mints its token. The daemon refuses to grant a scope the approving
 * device does not itself hold, so this CLI cannot mint an account more
 * powerful than the one it is using. `invite` composes the two calls for the
 * common case where one operator is doing both; see its own doc comment for
 * why that composition grants nothing the two steps could not.
