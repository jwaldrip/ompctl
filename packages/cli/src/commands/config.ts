 * daemon reads it once at its own startup and never again, so there is no
 * route that could change it even if one existed. Editing the file directly
 * is not a shortcut around the daemon, it is the only way this value can be
 * touched between a stop and the next start, and `loadConfig` (the daemon's
 * own function, imported rather than re-implemented) is still the one place
 * its shape is enforced.

 * than derived from the pid, because pids are recycled and an `wx` create
 * against a leftover from a dead process would refuse every future write until
 * someone deleted a file they never knew was there. Any failure before the
