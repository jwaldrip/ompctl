 * has to know where to put a binary and whether that place is on `PATH`.
 * `install` has to name a program in a launch agent, and a launch agent is the
 * one artifact here that outlives every process involved: launchd will hold
 * that path across reboots long after whoever typed the command has forgotten
 * it. Naming a path inside a checkout there is not a small mistake. A linked
 * git worktree is deleted the moment its branch is done with, and the login
 * agent then fails at every login, silently, forever.
 *
 * So the checkout test is the load-bearing part of this file, and it walks up
 * looking for a `.git` entry of either kind. A linked worktree's `.git` is a
 * FILE holding a `gitdir:` pointer, not a directory, which is exactly the case
 * an `isDirectory` check would wave through.
