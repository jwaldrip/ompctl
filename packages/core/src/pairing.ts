/**
 * Where a device connects, as a value both ends can print and parse.
 *
 * The phone shipped unusable for a reason that had nothing to do with the
 * phone: the app suggested `ws://127.0.0.1:7777/v1/socket`, and on a phone
 * loopback is the phone. The operator was expected to already know the
 * daemon's address. The daemon is the only thing that knows it, so the daemon
 * says it, and this file is the shape of what it says.
 *
 * ## Deliberately no credential
 *
 * An endpoint is not a secret and nothing here carries one. The bearer token
 * stays where `ompd approve` puts it: printed once, copied by the operator,
 * typed into its own field. Putting it in a URL alongside the address would
 * read as convenient and would push a long-lived credential through clipboard
 * history, shell history, and -- once anything registers this scheme -- OS
 * deep-link dispatch, all of which are logged in places a token should never
 * be. The pairing code is not a substitute either: it is short by design and
 * authorizes nothing, and a device that could spend one to collect a token
 * would have turned six digits into a credential.
 *
 * So this is an address, the operator remains the one who hands over the
 * credential, and the two halves stay separate.
 *
 * ## Two transports, because there are two situations
 *
 * `direct` is a websocket the device opens itself: loopback for a client on
 * the same machine, a LAN address for a phone on the same network. `hub` is a
 * daemon reached through a relay it dialled out to, which is the only thing
 * that works when the laptop is behind NAT. A hub endpoint is not a URL the
 * client opens: it is a hub base plus the daemon's pinned fingerprint, because
 * the session inside it is sealed to that daemon and the relay is not a party
 * to it. See `docs/hub.md`.
