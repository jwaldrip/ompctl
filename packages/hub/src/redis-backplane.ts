/**
 * The backplane Cloud Run actually runs on.
 *
 * Two connections, because a Redis connection in subscribe mode cannot issue
 * ordinary commands. One publishes and holds the presence leases, the other
 * does nothing but listen on this instance's channel.
 *
 * Leases are compare-and-set on renew and compare-and-delete on release, both
 * as scripts so the check and the write cannot be separated by another
 * instance's write. Without that, an instance whose lease had already been
 * taken over by a reconnecting daemon would renew or delete the new holder's
 * entry, and the daemon would become unroutable while looking perfectly
 * healthy.
 *
 * A daemon reconnecting to a different instance overwrites the lease outright.
 * That is deliberate: the daemon's live socket is the truth about where it is,
 * and the previous holder finds out when its next renew returns false.
