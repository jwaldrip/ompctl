/**
 * What the hub writes down.
 *
 * Structured JSON on stdout, because on Cloud Run that *is* the durable sink:
 * the platform ships stdout to Cloud Logging, which outlives the instance. A
 * file would not, and a database would be a second thing to run for a stream
 * nobody queries interactively.
 *
 * Every refusal is recorded, and each one names which door closed. "Refused"
 * on its own cannot tell an unenrolled daemon from a client whose token was
 * withdrawn, and those call for opposite responses from an operator.
 *
 * Nothing sensitive can be recorded here because nothing sensitive reaches
 * this process: the hub never holds a bearer token, and payloads are sealed
 * before they arrive. `payload` is therefore never a field, deliberately, so
 * that no later edit can quietly start logging ciphertext or anything else.
