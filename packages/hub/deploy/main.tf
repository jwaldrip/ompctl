# The hub, on Cloud Run. NOT APPLIED. Deploys run in CI on this project, never
# from a workstation, so this is the description of the target and nothing here
# has been executed.
#
# Two choices are load-bearing and worth reading before changing.
#
# `min_instance_count = 1`. The hub holds websockets, and an instance that
# scales to zero drops every daemon on it. The daemons reconnect, so this is a
# cost decision rather than a correctness one, but a hub that is always cold is
# a hub that is always reconnecting.
#
# Memorystore, not memory. Two legs of one session routinely land on two
# instances, and Cloud Run session affinity is best-effort, which is not a
# correctness mechanism. The routing table therefore lives outside the process.
# Without this the service only works pinned to a single instance.

# Backend and provider pins.
#
# The bucket is intentionally NOT hardcoded here (unlike cld/field-agent):
# ompctl lives in its own GCP project rather than shared-project, so the bucket
# name is supplied at `terraform init -backend-config="bucket=..."` time by
# CI. `prefix` alone is safe to commit; it carries no account information.
